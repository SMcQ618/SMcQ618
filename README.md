# ðŸ’« About Me:
I am a third-year Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Northeastern University. With a growing passion for robotics, high-performance computing, and exploring the realm of coding. I am currently working with a NURobotics ðŸ¤– on a building an interacting Robotic Arm that uses computer vision to replicate the movements of the user. <br>While also learning more about High Performance Computing and parallel computing through CPU and GPU through the works of NVIDIA's CUDA
